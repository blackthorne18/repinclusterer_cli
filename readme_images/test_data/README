# To download repinclusterer
	pip3 uninstall repinclusterer
	pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ repinclusterer


# Running it 
If you have the REPINs in a neat file
	repinclusterer --repin ./test_data/repins.txt --genomes ./test_data/genomes/
If you are running this after RAREFAN
	repinclusterer --repin ./test_rarefan/repins.txt --genomes ./test_rarefan/genomes/ --withrarefan 1

# Note on running with RAREFAN
The test_rarefan has files in the same format as the RAREFAN output but only contains the ss files.
Also, RAREFAN outout doesn't have genome fasta files(because this is RAREFAN input). These have to be provided separately
